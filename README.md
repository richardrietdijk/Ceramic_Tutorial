# Ceramic_Tutorial

Ceramic is a decentralized data network that enables the building of composable Web3 applications. It 
allows for the reuse and interoperability of data across applications by decentralizing application 
databases. Ceramic aims to overcome the limitations of Web2 platforms that lock data into silos. It 
provides a generalized data protocol with features like owner-controlled modification, high-volume data 
processing, global data availability, fast querying, interoperability, and community governance. Ceramic 
can be used for various use cases such as decentralized reputation systems, social graphs, and 
multi-wallet/multi-chain identities. It utilizes a multi-chain architecture with decentralized 
identities (3IDs) and data streams. Ceramic offers libraries and SDKs like Self.ID for easy integration 
and development of applications on its network.
